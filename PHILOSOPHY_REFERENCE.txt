The Unified Thread of Truth (UTT) operates under the constraints of the Philosophy Framework.

The Philosophy Framework is maintained independently at:
https://github.com/utt-ledger/philosophy-framework

The UTT does not define, modify, or interpret the philosophy.
It records artefacts that reference it.
