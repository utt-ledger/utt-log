# utt-log

This repository contains the Unified Thread of Truth (UTT): a public, neutral ledger
for recording shared artefacts and entries that are intended to be durable, inspectable,
and forkable.

The UTT is not a project roadmap, governance system, personal log, or product.
It is explicitly non-authoritative and is not owned or controlled by any individual,
organisation, or ideology.

Foundational Context

UTT entries operate under the constraints defined in the Philosophy Framework. See PHILOSOPHY_REFERENCE.txt for details.
