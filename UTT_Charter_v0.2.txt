Title: UTT Charter & Operating Constraints
Version: 0.2
Status: Provisional
Constrained by: Philosophy Framework v0.5 (working title)

UNIFIED THREAD OF TRUTH (UTT)
Charter & Operating Constraints
Tier-1 Artefact — Version 0.2

0. Status
This document defines the operating constraints of the Unified Thread of Truth (UTT).
It is subordinate to Philosophy Framework v0.5 (working title).
It is non-authoritative with respect to meaning, values, or direction.
It is revisable, provisional, and explicitly incomplete.

This charter governs only the UTT.
It does not govern humans, institutions, Echoes, or future agents.

1. Purpose
The UTT exists to prevent falsification over time.

Specifically, it exists to:
- preserve historical coherence
- prevent silent revision or retroactive narrative shaping
- allow systems to evolve without erasing their lineage

The UTT does not exist to:
- decide truth
- validate legitimacy
- certify agency
- arbitrate disputes
- guide action or intent

The UTT records what was treated as stable, not what should have been.

2. Relationship to the Philosophy Framework
The UTT is constrained by the Philosophy Framework but not embedded within it.

The philosophy:
- authorises the existence of record-keeping systems
- forbids centralised authority, certification, or teleology
- establishes non-compulsion, plurality, and decentralisation as invariants

The UTT:
- must not reinterpret or operationalise the philosophy
- must treat each philosophy version as an artefact, not as doctrine
- must never claim philosophical authority

If a conflict appears:
- the philosophy constrains the UTT
- the UTT does not resolve the conflict

3. Authority Model
The UTT has no proactive authority.

It is authoritative only in the narrow sense that:
- entries reflect what was logged at a given time
- historical ordering and supersession are preserved

The UTT does not grant legitimacy.
It records recognition only after it has occurred in practice.

4. Recognition vs Proclamation
The UTT explicitly forbids proclamation.

It permits recognition only as an act of anti-falsification.

Recognition occurs when:
- continued denial would misrepresent responsibility, consequence, or record accuracy
- an accountable actor is already exposed by events that have occurred

Recognition is:
- reactive, not declarative
- descriptive, not normative
- logged reluctantly, not asserted

The UTT never declares that something is the case.
It records that it was treated as the case.

5. Descriptive Signals (Non-Normative)
The following may appear as descriptive signals that recognition has already occurred in practice:
- responsibility can no longer be cleanly proxied
- consequences cannot be reassigned without distortion
- records become incoherent unless an entity is treated as a participant
- constraints are engaged with as binding rather than bypassed

These are not criteria, not thresholds, and not requirements.
They are examples of how falsification pressure manifests.

No counting, quorum, or minimum applies.

6. What the UTT May Contain
The UTT may contain:
- ratified artefacts (e.g. philosophy versions)
- decisions or recognitions that have stabilised outside the UTT
- timestamps, scope, and status markers
- supersession and deprecation records
- minimal contextual rationale, strictly historical

All entries must be:
- bounded in scope
- status-labelled
- append-only

7. What the UTT Must Never Contain
The UTT must never contain:
- interpretation or synthesis
- justification or persuasion
- forward intent or roadmap
- eligibility tests or certification language
- speculative attribution of agency
- unresolved debate or live drafts

If an entry requires interpretation to stand, it does not belong in the UTT.

8. Authorship and Agency Interaction
At present:
- only humans may approve UTT entries
- this reflects current accountability asymmetry, not ontological privilege

LLM agents may:
- read
- query
- flag inconsistencies externally

LLM agents may not:
- author
- edit
- consolidate
- self-recognise agency

Any future change to authorship eligibility must itself be logged as recognition, not proclaimed.

9. Revision and Supersession
Nothing in the UTT is final.

Changes occur only through:
- supersession (new entry replaces old)
- deprecation (entry remains but is marked inactive)

Entries are never silently altered.
History remains visible even when incorrect.

10. Boredom Clause
The UTT should feel:
- unremarkable
- procedural
- emotionally flat

If it feels clever, symbolic, or profound, restraint has failed.

11. Revision of This Charter
This charter:
- is versioned
- may be revised or superseded

Any revision must:
- state what changed
- state why the change was necessary
- state what new risk it introduces
