UTT ENTRY SCHEMA
Tier-1.5 Artefact — Draft v0.1

1. What the Entry Schema Is
The Entry Schema defines how entries are written, not what is true.
It constrains format, not judgement.

2. Core Design Rules (Non-Negotiable)
Every UTT entry must:
- be append-only
- have a single explicit scope
- declare its status
- reference what it supersedes (if anything)
- separate recorded fact from contextual rationale
- be readable without external explanation

3. Required Fields (All Entries)

3.1 Entry ID
Unique identifier.
Recommended format:
UTT-YYYY-NNNNNN
Example:
UTT-2025-000001

3.2 Entry Type
One of:
- Artefact
- Decision
- Recognition
- Revision
- Deprecation
- Incident

3.3 Title

3.4 Timestamp
ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

3.5 Scope
Narrowly bounded applicability.

3.6 Status
One of:
- Provisional
- Stable
- Superseded
- Deprecated

3.7 Supersedes
Reference to earlier entry IDs, or None.

3.8 Recorded Fact
Single past-tense factual statement of what was logged.

3.9 Contextual Rationale (Optional)
Minimal historical context only.

3.10 References (Optional)
Pointers to external artefacts.

4. Entry Types (Clarified)
Artefact, Decision, Recognition, Revision, Deprecation, Incident.

5. Explicit Exclusions

- no agent-authored consolidation
- no authority attribution

6. Canonical Storage
One entry per plain-text file:
UTT-2025-000001.txt

7. Status
This schema is Draft v0.1 and must be tested before stabilisation.
