# UTT Entries

This directory contains individual entries recorded in the Unified Thread of Truth (UTT).

Each entry is a discrete artefact, published at a specific point in time, and identified by a monotonic ID.  
Entries are not opinions, endorsements, or conclusions. They record the existence of a claim, event, or articulation.

Entries do not assert truth by inclusion.  
Absence of an entry does not imply absence of truth.

Interpretation is external to the ledger.

## Naming Convention

Each entry file follows the format:

UTT-YYYY-NNNNNN.txt

Where:
- `YYYY` is the year of publication
- `NNNNNN` is a zero-padded, monotonically increasing identifier
- Identifiers are assigned sequentially and never reused

The filename is treated as part of the record and should not be altered once published.

## Entry Stipulations

- Entries are append-only. Published entries are not edited or rewritten.
- Corrections, retractions, or supersessions are recorded as new entries that reference prior IDs.
- Entries may reference external frameworks or documents but do not modify them.
- No entry carries authority over another by default.

The ledger records artefacts, not resolution.
